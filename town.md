# Farshore Town Mechanics
Farshore town is potentially self-sustaining. Without PC intervention, the Mayor and town leaders will determine what everyone will be doing, building, and working on. For the most part, everyone in Farshore understands the requirements of survival, so even unsupervised, the NPC villagers will not go around burning their crops and partying.

However, fully unsupervised NPCs will not survive long-term either. The players will need to either direct the townsfolk in their rebuilding efforts, contribute to the efforts by adventuring and exploring, or both.

The town runs on several trackable resources:

* **Population**: Each "unit" of population is 20 commoners, 10 skilled workers, or 5 specialists.
  * Commoners can undertake most tasks with neither penalty nor bonus.
  * Skilled workers, such as hunters, smiths, bakers, craftspeople, tend to require more support- better food and more tools.
  * Specialists include nobles (who consume even more resources and may not show much for their labor), clerics, arcanists, armored fighters, and so on.
* **Morale**: Each unit of population hypothetically tracks morale separately, but this will usually all be the same. Many factors will influence morale, and actual morale may not be visible to PCs (secert insurrections, etc). Morale has a direct effect on labor efficiency and can also lead to uprisings (if poor) or other events (good and bad). 
* **Food**: 1 unit of food will feed one unit of population for one week.
  * Each unit of population that lacks food for the first week will roll with disadvantage on all labor checks for that week.
  * The second and subsequent weeks, that population is unable to work at all.
  * After four weeks without food, the unit will die from starvation
  * Rotating which populations get food is a good way to prevent people from dying of starvation
  * Lack of food will also dramatically impact morale.
*  **Wood**: Wood must be harvested from nearby forests and processed for building material and other uses.
*  **Stone**: Stone can be quarried from unused foundations and ruined buildings, as well as from actual quarries.
*  **Metal**: Advanced craftspeople and buildings will require metal. Find metal resources in caches throughout the island, mine for ores.
* **Other**: There are plenty of other resources that will be discovered during gameplay, such as livestock, exotic trade goods, and arcane resources.

### Trading and Conquest
It is possible to gain resources for the town without just harvesting the resources using town labor (although that is also feasible as well for at least some resources). Trading ships will arrive in Farshore Port every six months (in spring and fall); the ships will usually bring staple goods such as wood, metal, and food. The trading ship captains will expect to be paid.

There will be other opportunities for trade that arise during the game.

## Labor

Every day, the general labor pool of commoners can do regular tasks, which are determined (broadly) by the tools and buildings available to the town.

Each work group can work on a task for a day. Some goals require multiple "units" of work. Generally speaking, those units must occur sequentially - building a house takes three units of work, so normally would take three days. You can't just assign three groups to get it done faster. (exception: see the "speed the work" activity).

If there are not enough PC or specialist NPC characters to lead work parties, commoners can do town maintenance tasks. Commoners without work are idled. Town NPCs should be idle between 20 and 50% of the time for optimal morale. Commoners can work more than 80% of the time for short stints if there is an impending crisis, but without a good reason there will be discontent. Commoners idled for more than 50% of the time can also reduce morale

**General resolution:** Each task has a DC. This is a standard d20 roll, modified by the town's morale (up or down). Each day's work has a base efficiency of 1: the work party generates one unit of resources, completes one unit of work, and so forth.

Work parties must be led by a leader. A leader is a named character (one of the party, or an NPC specialist). That leader has the following effects:
* If the leader is proficient in Persuasion or Intimidation, apply +1.
* If the leader is proficient in an appropriate skill, an additional +2.

Once task difficulty is determined, the leader rolls the d20, adds their bonus and checks against the task DC. Here's the success table:

* **Natural 1**: Task fails, the work party is sidelined for a day, and someone died in an accident. Reduce the population by 1.
* **Fail by 5 or more**: Task fails, the work party is sidelined for a day.
* **Fail by less than 5**: Task succeeds, work party is sidelined for a day.
* **Success by less than 5**: Task succeeds.
* **Success by more than 5**: Task succeeds, +1 efficiency.
* **Natural 20**: Task succeeds, +1 efficiency, and bonus aweseomeness (based on task)

## Buildings
Each building has a description, effects, and cost.  Unless otherwise noted, all building work is DC 10. Any building that has more than 6 units of work outstanding can have a second work crew assigned. The second crew's work has a -2 penalty. A building that has 12 units of work outstanding can have a third crew assigned at a total of -4 penalty.

* Small foundation: 1 unit stone, 3 units work.
* Medium foundation: 2 units stone, 5 units work.
* Large foundation: 3 units stone, 7 units work.
* Cleared farmland: 20 units work.

### Housing

The Farshore expedition will start in tents, some large, some single-person. The tents are not a long-term solution (between material breakdown and leaks), permanent housing needs to be built before the winter.

**Longhouse / Communal Building**: This is a basic dormitory that can house up to 40 people. Living here keeps the rain off, but there's little privacy. Medium foundation, 4 units wood, 16 units work. People housed in Communal housing for too long end up with low morale.

**Apartments**: More privacy than a bunkhouse, but still rather dense living. Large foundation, 8 wood, 24 work. Houses 40 commoners.

**Plain House**: Plain old house for a family. Three rooms, fireplace, outhouse. Nothing special. Small foundation, 2 units wood, 10 unit work. Required for skilled workers (who will lose morale if they live in apartments).

**Improved House**: This isn't a manor house, but it's pretty nice. Small foundation, 3 units wood, 15 units work. Can be an improvement on Plain House for 1 unit wood, 6 units work. Required for Specialists, who will lose morale if they live in lesser homes.

### Common Buildings
**Town Hall**: Center of town governance, must be built before any other organization can occur.

**Tavern**: +2 morale. Large foundation, 8 units wood, 12 units work. 5 food/week upkeep. Requires one unit of skilled labor to maintain.


### Specialist Buildings

**Chapel**: Must be an upgrade to a shrine. Additional +1 morale, improves work ratio, heals 1 sidelined work group per day. 1 stone, 4 wood, 20 work.

**Church**: Must be an upgrade to a chapel. Additional +2 morale, improves work ratio. Heals 2 sidelined work groups per day. Generates 1 food unit per week. 10 stone, 50 work.


Other Interesting Buildings

**Farm**: Generates 1 unit of food per week. Requires cleared farmland. 10 wood, 3 stone, 30 work. Upkeep: 1 unit skilled labor, but includes housing for same.

**Sawmill**: Must be located on the water. +2 efficiency to up to four units of lumbering work per day. Large foundation. 7 units wood, 15 units work.
